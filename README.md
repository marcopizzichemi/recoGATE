# recoGATE

create a folder parallel to this one, called build
then execute ./deploy.sh from this folder

the star.reco script can be run from any folder (with full path to the build folder of course) with input from any folder
example:

/path/to/build/start.reco --input /path/to/data/data.root --output-dir ./

will produce the relevant output in the folder from where you run it
